NeonFox Revision 1:
Created quartus project (18.1).
Initial cache and memory controller testing done separately.
Fixed bug memory controller that caused banks to be activated immediately before refresh.
Fixed bug in cache controller that caused a stall after reset and main memory initialization.
Fixed bug in cache controller that caused first write (from main memory) to happen at the wrong address.
Fixed bug in CPU decoder module that caused ADD instructions to be inserted instead of NOPs after reset or P miss.
Fixed bug in CPU decoder module that caused the first instruction after a P miss to be executed twice. This bug may be present in RIPTIDE 2 and 3.
Fixed bug in CPU PC module that caused incorrect address tracking after P miss. This bug may be present in RIPTIDE 2 and 3.
Fixed bug in CPU PC module that caused incorrect branch targets if P miss happens on cycle following a branch is taken. This bug may be present in RIPTIDE 2 and 3.
Fixed bug in CPU PC module that caused branch target to be executed twice if a branch is taken during P miss. This bug may be present in RIPTIDE 2 and 3.

Revision 2:
Optimized out cache LRU memory.
Updated MSC to support new cache controller.
Removed hex display registers in top level and used MSC page registers to drive hex displays and LEDs (paging not used).
Replaced MC6847_gen3 with MC6847_gen4 and updated VGA module for HDMI output.
Fixed bug in MC6847_gen4 module. The fix was copied from the MC6847_gen3 module from the RIPTIDE-III project.
Fixed bug in NeonFox (Missing hazard detection for CALL or JMP after writing CAH or CAL).
Fixed bug in hex display driver (seg_sel was inverted).
Fixed bug in register file (independent forwarding for high and low bytes).
Fixed bug in ALU (LIM H was not working).
Fixed bug in PC (Missing some branch hazard checks for CALL and JMP).
Fixed multiple bugs in memory controller, some performance issues still need to be fixed (activate bank before IO machine becomes idle).
Fixed bug in PC module (A_next_I need to be stopped by hazard).
Fixed bug in PC unit (D miss does not stop the CPU).
Fixed bug in SDRAM controller (precharge timer cleared wrong flag).
Fixed bug in SDRAM controller (timing issue with burst offset counters in IO state machine).
Fixed bug in cache controller (incorrect mem_wren output).
Fixed bug in register file (wrong DIO timing).
Fixed bug in SDRAM controller (Timing issue in memory writes).
